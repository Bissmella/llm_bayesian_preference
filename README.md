# Bayesian preference learning for LLM alignment.

This is a self-contained notebook-based implementation of preference model for LLM alignment based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05782).

The MI dataset used for training the preference model can be downloaded from this [link](https://github.com/anuradha1992/Motivational-Interviewing-Dataset/blob/main/MI%20Dataset.csv).

The notebook can be executed easily in kaggle or colab using the pre-processed and ready dataset in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bissmellabahaduri/preference-learning).
